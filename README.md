# ScheduleHub
![Tests](https://github.com/ethanc-ec/ScheduleHub/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

A small project made simply because I'm too lazy to do graduation and class requirements by hand.

To Use:
  1. Download everything and keep it all in one folder
  2. Run the modes.py file with an IDE or Terminal/Command Prompt
    - There is an option to create a batch file to make running the code easier
  
Future Features:
  - GUI
  - Auto schedule maker using specified parameters and classes
