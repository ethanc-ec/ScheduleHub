# ScheduleHub

A small project made simply because I'm too lazy to do graduation and class requirements by hand.

To Use:
  1. Download everything and keep it all in one folder
  2. Run the modes.py file with python or an IDE
  
Future Features:
  - GUI
  - Auto schedule maker using specified parameters and classes
