The dynamic nature of AI systems requires a new set of skills informed by ethics, law, and policy to be applied throughout the life cycle of such systems: design, development and deployment. It also involves ongoing collaboration among data scientists, computer scientists, lawyers and ethicists. Tackling these challenges calls for an interdisciplinary approach: deconstructing these issues by discipline and reconstructing with an integrated mindset, principles and practices between data science, ethics and law. This course aims to do so by bringing together students with diverse disciplinary backgrounds into teams that work together on joint tasks in an intensive series of in- class sessions. These sessions will include lectures, discussions, and group work.

In many cases, it is no longer possible to design feasible algorithms that can freely access the entire data set. Instead of that we often have to resort to techniques that allow for reducing the amount of data such as sampling, sketching, dimensionality reduction, and core sets. Also explores scenarios in which large data sets are distributed across several machines or even geographical locations and the goal is to design efficient communication protocols or MapReduce algorithms. Includes a final project and programming assignments in which we explore the performance of our techniques when applied to publicly available data sets.

We cover the analysis of reasoning with truth-functions (\"and\", \"or\", \"not\", \"if ... then\") and with quantifiers (\"all\", \"some\"), attending to formal languages and axiomatic systems for logical deduction. Throughout, we aim to clearly and systematically display both the theory underlying the norms of valid reasoning and their applications to particular problems of argumentation. The course is an introduction to first-order quantificational logic, a key tool underlying work in foundations of mathematics, philosophy of language and mind, philosophy of science and parts of syntax and semantics.

Students will be expected to research how a book augments their studio practice and how word and image are particularly important in expressing ideas that further their goals as an artist. In all cases content, form and materials must work together in creating a complete work. Regular critiques, both individual and group, will emphasize learning goals. Students are encouraged to include various mediums in book format, whether two or three dimensional, and to expand the boundaries of their process in new ways. Guest artists, trips to artist book collections, studio visits, and student presentations will be featured.",

Lithography is one of the oldest printmaking mediums, but perhaps the most versatile. It can mimic a pastel drawing, a watercolor, a fine line engraving or a photograph, utilizing both traditional stone as well as aluminum plates and other substrates. The intrinsic nature of a print involves drawing, creating multiples, opacities and transparencies utilizing various materials as drawing tools. Color layering and sequences, building upon an image and taking it away again, all lead to the versatility of the medium. Color mixing, ink modification, registration and the printing of multiple-run lithographs will be taught, with an emphasis on experimentation in size, series, and thinking beyond the flat surface. A disciplined approach to cooperative print shop use, how a professional print atelier runs, and proper care and maintenance of equipment will be covered. Students will build confidence in printing editions, working collaboratively with invited artists, and developing work that supports and extends their overall studio practice. Critiques, both one-on-one and in groups, combined with presentations on well-known artists, visits to professional print ateliers and print collections, and guest speakers will showcase current trends in the medium and its part in the contemporary printmaking landscape.",

A variety of scholars and performing artists will be invited to give a workshop on music/dance and discuss their lives as musicians. Over the course of the semester, you will gain an understanding of the myriad ways people use music to construct and individual group identities, the diverse ways groups incorporate music into their lives, and how to understand music within a broader historical, political, and economic context. You will also be introduced to basic musical concepts and terminology, and acquire listening skills that will enable you to better encounter and understand music in this course and beyond.

In this course, we will investigate both the whats and whys of productions like this wacky version of Daphnis: choreographers who entirely reimagine canonical ballets such as Swan Lake, Giselle, Sleeping Beauty, and The Rite of Spring among others. To that end, we work to understand the political as well as the aesthetic implications of these remade productions.

The implications of assuming leadership are vast----vision, exertion, generosity, intelligence, precision, responsibility, compassion ... Furthermore, to lead cannot mean to ignore the complex reality we live in as a society: Inequity, social disparities, structural racism and discrimination are not undesired mistakes, but structural aspects of the world we live in. In other words, the way our society defines what is \"leadership\" and \"who should lead\" has the power to perpetuate, or for the same matter, dismantle these issues. Our collective inquiry and discussion will inevitably deal with this pressing reality. A group of global art leaders, activists and entrepreneurs from across the globe will join the forum to illustrate, enrich and guide this discussion. The \"Art Leaders Forum\" is a co-creation process in need of every voice and every view that engages in it. Tourism is not an option here: taking part in the forum clearly demands something of each of us----to fully listen and to dare to be heard; to be seen and to see others and their reality. To support and enhance such demanding work the course will introduce notions of mindfulness, entrepreneurship, active listening, embodiment and non-violent communication, at the time that will study and explore different models of leadership, activism, community and social impact in the arts.",

Movements in theatrical practices will be explored via the lens of technological, socio-economic and political forces and how they shaped and informed theatre production in the United States, Europe and Eastern Europe. As artists, we use this exploratory approach to theatre history to inform our choices in producing thought, not just consuming of it. Effective Fall 2019, this course is part of a Hub sequence: when taken with CFA TH 555, this course fulfills a single unit in each of the following Hub areas: Historical Consciousness, Research and Information Literacy.",

The course is designed with an intent of putting oneself in the shoes of a clinician as well as a manager, with acknowledgement that leaders in the health care environment are rarely able to ignore sound management principles and understanding of healthcare systems for long. Whether knowing what is being asked of you as a clinician, or being placed in a leadership position, many health and rehabilitation professionals will assume the role of a manager or have leadership responsibilities during the course of their career, often sooner than expected. The increasing rate of change in the healthcare environment is a major factor in this emphasis on leadership. This can take many forms, and an emphasis will be placed on how one can assume a position of leading in different avenues. This course will help foster the growth of an individual's knowledge and capacity to lead, in whatever form it takes. This course also develops and enhances the students' understanding of the health care system, the social and economic forces affecting the health care system, and its ability to function effectively. Additionally, the course will prepare students to enter the workforce by introducing them to a variety of tools and experiences that will enable them to manage organizations, programs, resources, and people more effectively.

Students will also be given a number of readings around which discussion will take place. Discussion will emphasize how students might incorporate the lessons from their readings into the next presentation. Finally students will be required to develop a detailed course outline and schedule and a sample lesson. Ideally this will be preparation for a class that the student may eventually teach. The primary emphasis will be on teaching of medium to large classes using the lecture method.",

Readings will be mainly historical but will also include relevant cases and legislation; all readings will be available online or on the seminar's Blackboard website. Grades will be based primarily on the term paper, on an approved topic, which is written after comments have been received on a polished draft; class participation will also be considered, as well as the weekly log that seminar members are required to maintain, noting issues raised by the readings. OBJECTIVES: Students will be expected to become familiar with the history of racial and ethnic stratification in the United States as well as resistance to it, enabled to pursue that history on their own, and capable of appraising relevant scholarship and public policies. The CR/NC/H grading option is available. LAW ENROLLMENT LIMIT: 15 students. NOTE: This class does not satisfy the upper-class writing requirement. ** A student who fails to attend the initial meeting of a seminar (designated by an (S) in the title), or to obtain permission to be absent from either the instructor or the Registrar, may be administratively dropped from the seminar.
