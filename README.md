# ScheduleHub
[![Tests](https://github.com/ethanc-ec/SlapThatLikeButton-TestingStarterProject/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ethanc-ec/SlapThatLikeButton-TestingStarterProject/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

A small project made simply because I'm too lazy to do graduation and class requirements by hand.

To Use:
  1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ethanc-ec/ScheduleHub/releases) and keep it all in one folder
  2. Run the sch_hub.py file with an IDE or Terminal/Command Prompt
  
Future Features:
  - GUI
  - Auto schedule maker using specified parameters and classes
